# Competetive Programming Helper

This basic C++ library provides utility functions for competitive programming (CP) that simplify common tasks such as input/output handling and data structure construction. It is designed to help you focus on solving problems rather than spending time setting up the necessary input/output infrastructure.

The library *should* work on all platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).
